// TODO: Add delete account functionality, need to do research on how

// might be a little complicated due to authentication issues

//seems to be some issue console logging from the action function, however if you return the object and
//console log in this file everything seems to work

//possible way to do it is to have deleteFunction add user to the table and then have a trigger delete all users
//in that table
